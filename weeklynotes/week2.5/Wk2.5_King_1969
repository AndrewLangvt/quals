## Paper- King & Jukes 1969
	
### Reasoning:
There was a focus on natural selection dictating changes in DNA, but King & Jukes strive here to present theory to the contrary- alterations at the DNA level are selected for or against if they are beneficial or deterimental, respectively, but selection does not revert mutations that pose no adjustment to fitness. 

I take issue with pg 789- Of the 2N copies of a gene in a population of N individuals at one point in evolutionary time, only one is destined to become the ancestor *(through replication)*?? Replication is a mitotic function, not meiotic, which would be how it would become the ancestor of "all copies of that gene" in the future. 

Further down the page, they argue that the rate of non Darwinian evolutionary change is independent of population size... dont understand when it is a function of neutral mutation rate per functional gamete per generation. Larger population, more functional gametes...

They draw attention to the focus of empirical studies focusing on observable mutations- those that alter morphology or physiological function. For the 22 nonsense mutations that occurred in one study (549 possible single base substitutions, 392 nonsynonymous, and 23 are nonsense), they argue that likely 525 mutations occurred with 375 aa changes yet went unnoticed as they did not result in gene inactivation. 

Minute amount of mistakes made in replication due to polymerization error are likely a driving force of evolution

They didnt know CDS make up only ~2% of the human genome.  Interesting to read a paper where they posit arguments to support the "existence of superfluous DNA." :-D
*Much of this study was conceptualized outside of the framework of a true understanding of the human genome. Scientific method can only be as accurate as the current understanding of science*

### Importance:

This paper highlights an underlying consistency of change and mutation that occurrs independent of environment, population size, and selection.  Selection will act upon these changes, but change will exist regardless.  Many at this time were heavily in the Darwin Camp, believing natural seletion is the driver of all evolution.  King & Jukes present strong evidence for genetic drift, though they do not refer to it as such. By observing the differences in "hybridability" between orthologous sequences, and the probability of synonymous vs non-synonymous mutations, they emphasize the statistical improbability that mutation rates and frequences are really as low as other studies have suggested.  The method in which mutation was studied (lethal or large fitness alteration) implicitly lacks the resolution to observe slightly-deleterious mutations, and neutral ones.
