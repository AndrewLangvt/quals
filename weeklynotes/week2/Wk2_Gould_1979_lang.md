## Paper- Gould and Lewontin. 1979. The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptionist Programme

### Reasoning:
This paper attempts to address the pervasive perspective in many biologists which attributes the current state of an organism entirely to natural selection and adaptation, grounded in the belief that natural selection is a powerful optimizing agent. 

The adaptation perspective divides an organism into unique parts or "traits" and then assumes that each trait has been fully optimized by NS.  Any traits that are found to be suboptimal are assume to be so in response to a "trade-off" with the optimization of another trait such that the organism, as a whole, is at it's optimum form, even if particular traits may be very sub-optimal. 

Panglossian perspective- Our world may not be good in an abstract sense, but it is the very best we could have. Each trait plays its part and must be as it is.

####Adaptionist argument styles

1. if one argument fails, present another  (external structures- horns/antlers- were once thought to be weapons, but then were believed to be symbols of intraspecific competition among males). 
2. if the argument fails, assume another must exist- a weaker version of the first argument. 
3. in the absence of a good adaptive argument, attribute failure to imperfect understanding of where an organism lives and what it does
4. emphasize immediate utility and exclude other attributes of form (t-rex front legs. many uses suggested, but likely simply a reduction of forelegs as seen in functional homologues in ancestors).

####Alternatives to immediate adaptation to explain form/function/behavior
By using the above four styles of argument, once can undertake a study and essentially deem any results to be satisfactory, regardless if they truly are accurate or pointing toward the mechanism the researchers posit. Darwin was explicit that he approached adaptation and evolution with a pluralistic perspective.  

1. No adaptation and no selection. How much of the genetic polymorphisms & differences w/in a population are actually a result of NS, vs. purely random factors? 

	A.) Populations and species can become genetically differentiated (even fixed) for alleles in the complete absence of any selective force.
	
	B.) Alleles can become fixed *in spite of NS*. 

	C.) New mutations, even if they are the "best" optimization, have a VERY small chance of persisting in a population. 
	
2. No adaptation and no selection at the tissue level. Selection acts elsewhere, which then is correlated to the formation of a part. 
3. Decoupling of selection and adaptation

	A.) Selection (no adaptation). Organism suddenly has increase in fecundity, but resulting additional offspring still die due to resource limitation.  
	B.) Adaptation(no selection). Genetically idential individuals assume different shapes in different microhabitats. 
		
		Adaptation
		- Physiological "adaptations" ability to mold the form to circumstances during ontogeny (high altitute).  
			Not heritable- I would argue there is substantial question, and even some evidence to the contrary 
			of this.  The heritability of epigenetic modifications seem to present a fashion that these 
			"adaptations" could be heritable.
		- Cultural adaptation- heritability is thus imposed by learning
		- Conventional Darwinian adaptation- selection upon genetic variation. 

4. Adaptation and selection, but differences among adaptations is not based upon selection. There exist many examples where "multiple adaptive peaks" have arisen- multiple solutions to the same problem, where no one solution is better than the rest. 
5. Adaptation and selection, but adaptation is secondary- the utilization of parts which are present due to development/history

Contstraints

	- Phyletic- arise from architectural restrictions that were not previous adaptations, but an essential 
		consequence of materials and designs of the basic "body plan"
	- Developmental- subcatgory of phyletic- early stages of ontogeny dictate and confine the oranism to particular 
		evolutionary pathways. 

### Importance:

The major position of this paper is to convey, not a false or untrue nature of NS or adaptation, but instead the incomplete picture it is able to present of evolution.  Instead, one must adopt a pluralistic approach when attempting to determine where and how current traits may have arisen.  Perhaps these traits are indeed the result of NS working within an organism to adapt to the environment in the best way possible, but almost certainly there are other factors at play- perhaps even entirely responsible for the present physiological form of an organism.
