## Paper- Lewinton, RC. 1970. The Units of Selection

##### Darwins 3 principles of evolution by natural selection:
1. phenotypic variation
2. differential fitness
3. fitness is hertiable

##### Malthusianism
Checks that regulate population size, maintaining a suitable level

1. preventive checks- moral restraints (abstinence, delayed marriage)
2. positive checks- lead to premature death (disease, starvation, war)

principles of selection and evolution can be applied to anything that satisfies the 3 principles- can look at a population, species, or even a community

###Selection of Molecules

coacervates (colloid-rich viscous liquid phase that may separate from a colloidal solution on addition of a third component) were the first units upon which natural selection operated.  Consider this in light of the first RNA "species." 

###Cell Organelle Selection

mitochondria, kinetosomes, chromosomes

segregation distortion of lethal sterile genes in *Mus musculus*
	
	3 levels of selection
		- organelle selection (segregation distortion)
		- organismic selection (lethality or sterility of HM individuals)
		- population selection (setrile alleles- small pop may become HM, and thus extinct)

A heterokaryon is a multinucleate cell that contains genetically different nuclei. If each nuclei is a mutant, but can supplement lacking component of other nuclei, replication can occurr.  Rate of replcation for each nuclei is dependent upon the other nuclei. 

###Cellular Selection

Antigen response

tissue repair (certain cell types will reproduce faster than usual, but return to normal when repair is complete) and neoplastic growth (normal feedback loop destroyed and certain cell types reproduce rapidly, competing with normal cells and crowding them out). 

###Gametic Selection

Differential motility, viability, and probability of fertilization of gametes arising from their own haploid genotype, independent of the genotype of the parents which formed them.

Pure gametic selection should be absent in nature except when selection at this level is opposed by selection at the individual or some higher level.  Otherwise, the superior genotype would be established in 100% of the population (minus the occasional mutant). 

###Individual Selection

the force on genetic composition of a populaiton that arises directly from differences in the age-specific mortality and fertility schedules of different genotypes *independent* of the genotypes of their ancestors, descendents, or contemporaneaous relatives.  

**Fishers Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection**- rate of change of population fitness with time is equal to the genetic variance in fitness--- does not apply for freq-dependent selection, multiple loci, nor to continuously breeding populations with age-distributed mortality or fecundity. 
	
in comparing levels of selection

1. rapidity of response to selection depends upon heritability of differences in fitness between units
2. rate of evolution per unit time is dependent upon rate of reproduction and mortality per unit time. 

####Population consequences of individual selection

absolute fitness- ratio of individuals w/a particular genotype after selection to those w/genotype before. 
relative fitness- comparison of number of survivng progeny of differing genotypes after one generation

confusing relative and absolute fitness

1. Individual selection has often led to the misconception that a population will make better use of its resources/have a higher rate of growth or larger size at genetic equilibrium than at disequilibrium. Yet, if we say that absolute fitnesses are functions of genotype frequencies, absolute reproductive rates may decrease while the population evolves to maximize relative fitnesses.  Additionally, if the total population size were to be fixed by an unchanging resource (space), genotypes would be constantly changing their relative an absolute fitness, thus keeping mean fitness constant. 
2. cost of selection and genetic load- (Genetic load is the deviation of the mean fitness of a population from the optimum genotype- i.e. if there were a single individual with the desired genotype)- genetic load does not correlate to a loss of reproductive capacity or population size. Think of when a population aquires a new gene; this doesn't increase any cost to the population, but does result in a large genetic load. 

####Kin Selection

altruism or social value- contradictory to principle of natural selection as individuals appear to lower their own fitness at the benefit of other organisms. (Maternal care, cooperative behavior of ants) Sterile castes are parts of a large "individual", the colony, so there is no difference between evolution of social insects and the evolution of division of labor among the cells of a higher organism. 

####Population Selection

1. Do we need to invoke it to explain evolutionary change
2. At what rate can evolution go on by such a mechanism
3. Does it happen

1- self-regulating properties of a population such that resources are not overexploited- cooperation does not lead to equilibrium as it is always advantageous to be uncooperative, at the indiviual level. Many adaptations are explicable by selection at the individual level (senescence- inceased selection for reproduction at earlier ages; alarm calls and maternal care- kin selection)

2- population must be HM for "cooperative" genes.  ANY mutation or introduction of alternatate alleles for selfish behavior will cause a rapid evolution within the pop in the wrong direction. 

Two examples of population selection potentially occurring- *t* gene in *Mus musculus* and evolution of myxoma in the rabbit *Oryctolaus cuniculus*

####Higher levels of selection

Species evolve to survive in a certain environment.  If the rate of change is slow enough, natural selection will allow phylogenetic line to survive even though the species may slowly transform. 99% of all phyla that have ever existed are extinct.  **Man, in the rapid shifting of habitats, is creating the conditions for efficient natural seletion of species and species relationships never before seen in the lifetime of evolution.**
