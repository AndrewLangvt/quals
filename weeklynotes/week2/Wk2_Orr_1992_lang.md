## Paper- Orr, H. Allen. 1992. The Genetics of Adaptation: A Reassessment.  

####Macromutations

1. Strong version- Single "systemic mutations" result in complex adaptations, formed to perfection on the first "attempt." (Goldschmidt suggested that these could be chromosomal rearrangements)
2. Weak version- one or a few alleles are the driving force, or the main contributors, to an adaptation

This paper strives to provide clarification of macromutation mechanisms, specifically if adaptations are generally the restlt of fixation of major genes as opposed to the incremental micromutations summing to a morphological shift which selection can act upon. 

Fisher argued that small displacement has a 50% chance of entering the sphere (improving adaptation), while a larger displacement has a much smaller chance of entering the sphere. Fisher also believed that adaptations were based upon *innumerable* adaptations, thus mutation would play little-to-no-role in evolution.  NS would shape adaptation out of an infinite supply of minute mutations. 

#####Issues with Fishers argument:

1. small mutations are more likely favorable, but not more likely substituted.  
	
	Kimura argues that a mutations probability of fixation is directly proportional to it's phenotypic effect.  Even if large mutations are less favorable to small ones, they are still fixed more easily. Fixation of a larger mutation contributes more to a trait, so these infrequent events could still account for the majority of selective response seen. 
	
2. does not apply in cases which multiple selective peaks exist. 
3. model assumes all phenotypic dimensions count equally- interactions of organismal parts have the same effect on fitness. 
4. deleterious effects of a major mutation may be dampened by the developmental system of organisms which likely has evolved to minimize the consequences of developmental accidents. 

Lande presents the theory that unless selection is very strong and persistent, adaptation will usually result from substitution of micromutations.  

#####Issues with Lande's Argument

1. it is not clear that evolution in nature usually invovles weak selection toward a slow moving optimum. (optimum can shift quickly, and strong selection can be common)
2. features of this argument seem to predispose it against fixation of large mutations (assumes that major mutation has deleterious pleiotropic effects while polygenic variation does not). More realistic to assume that both could have deleterious effects, with sizes proportional to 
3. allows for only a single allele of large effect. If additional loci were allowed to harbor such alleles, the fixation of at least one becomes more likely. 

**Lande's model presents a potentially more realistic perspective on evolution in that it allows for competition between major and minor genes, though it also seems to unrealistically lower the probability of evolution by major mutations.** 

**Frequency of large vs small mutation events in morphological genes.** Gregory concluded that mutations of large phenotypic effect are far more rare than those of small effect, yet he failed to performe any crosses (mutations, thus, were not geentic) and he did only scored the F2 generation (delay lowered chance of observing mutations of large effect) in a way that one couldnt determine if a high score reflected a single large mutation or multiple, smaller mutations. 

**Deleterious effects of small vs large mutations** Mutations in *Drosophila* have been seen to have a large phenotypic effect in HZ individuals, while leaving HM individuals very unfit. This may be the result of biases producing an artificial correlation between a mutation's phenotypic effect when HZ, and selective disadvantage when HM.

Simply because large mutations usually result in a decrease in fitness, does not mean that large mutations with a favorable effect suffer disproportionately more deleterious plieotripoic effects than mutations with smaller favorable effects. 

*Micromutations* Much of the foundaitonal evidence at that time for micromutations had been based upon non-evidence, or evidence with glaring inconsistencies. 

*Artifical selection* Large-effect mutations play a substantial role in breeding, though results of artificial selection in the lab are mixed- mono- and polygenic responses are seen.  Some macromutational responses to selection are dismissed (lab selection may be stronger than NS in the wild) while polygenic responses to selection are often treated as relevant.  This is perhaps a dangerous path to take, especially as some studies have shown polygenic traits in the lab are monogenic in nature (insecticide resistance, Roush 1987). 

*Disturbed populations in nature* Natural populations that have been disturbed by humans offer a more realistic test of micromutational theory in that the populations are still under ecological constraint otherwise absent in lab studies.  Many exmples of adaptation from large mutations. 

*Adaptations in natural populations* At the time of this paper, there were very few genetic analyses of diffences in adaptations between natural populations, though a large focus had been placed upon butterfly mimicry with several studies confirming that mimicry invovles multiple substitutions of genes of large effect.  This would suggest it may be easier to fix larger mutations than smaller ones. 

*Differences among species and subspecies* Many studies were focused on sexually dimorphic characteristics, potentially leading one to false conclusions regarding the frequency of polygenic evolution, as a whole.  Sexual selection, in particular, may "involve repeated and coordinated evolutionary changes in female preference and male ornamentations, the evolution of these characters might invovle the sequential substitution of alleles at many loci." 

On the other hand, morphological species differences of unknown adaptive significance may involve major genes (e.g., color differences in newts [Spurway 1953] or floral and vegetative characters in plants [Clausen and Hiesey 1958; Prazmo 1965]) or several to many genes of smaller effect (e.g., Clausen and Hiesey 1958). Even though the adaptive value of these changes is unknown, the **involvement of major genes refutes Fisher's (1930) assertion that major mutations almost always suffer severe, deleterious side effects.** 

The authors generated a table of genetic analyses of species differences with clear adaptations. This table contained only eight studies of clear adaptations, and many of them are sub-par in one way or another. From this table, they conclude that major gene effects are not particularly rare, and their evidence would not support the theory that interspecific adaptations are nearly always based on micromutations. 

criteria for table 1 analysis:

1. a genetic analysis powerful enough to distinguish between muta- tions of large and small effect (most studies employ genetic markers or test for Mendelian segregation; only one study relies on biometric estimates of gene number)
2. an interspecific difference of reasonably clear adaptive significance, and 
3. a character difference between species in nature and not between cultivars or other taxa subjected to artificial selection.

### Importance:
This paper challenges the ideas and theories of adaptation present in the early 90s.  The authors suggest that while there certainly may be many genes of small effect involved in adaptation, there is not enough evidence to suggest that adaptation cannot also be the result of few genes of large effect.  Additionally, they highlight the limited number of "true" adaptive studies, emphaisizing the numerous gaps and holes in theories at that time.
