## Paper- Miyata & Yasunaga 1980
	
### Reasoning:
Research had previously identified alpha and two beta globin genes of mice, and also beta-globin genes of rabbit, human, chicken, and two gamma-globin genes from humans. All are interrupted by two introns at homologous locations. At the time of this paper, two alpha-globin like genes from two different mice strains were isolated and clearly lacked the two introns.  Additionally, there were several deletions and insertions when comparing sequences to a WT alpha-globin-gene. Miyata & Yasunaga compare the mouse pseudo alpha-globin (Mpa) gene sequences to productive mouse (Ma) and rabbit alpha-globin (Ra) genes. 

### Methods:
They aligned the reads, and counted the number of mismatches, categorized as functional or structural regions (K). By comparing regional differences between Ma (Mouse alpha) & Mp (Mouse psi) to Ra (Rabbit alpha) & Mp, they identified that the majority of difference occurred after the divergence of mouse and rabbit, except for the 3' end of the 3'nc region, which derives from alpha-globin gene duplication. 

### Findings:

They found that the "difference K(Ma-Mpa) of each functional block was always smaller than K(Mr-Mpa) of the corresponding block" with the exception of the 3' end of the 3' noncoding region.  I.e. Mpa came about due to gene duplication of Ma following mouse and rabbit divergenc, meaning that Mpa divergence from Ra is the same as Ra from Ma and allows for direct comparison of K(Ra-Mpa) to K(Ma-Ra).  They hypothesized that, if pseudogenes evolve at the same rate as productive ones, these two values should be the same. K(Ra-Mpa) was always larger than K(Ma-Ra) at all blocks. They also saw significant increase in AA sites, 5' NC region, 3' portion of 3' NC region. As these are usually highly conserved (correct tertiary structure, signals for cap--- **check current lit for this**). From this, they suggest the entire Mpa sequence has no important function. They also identified in the synonymous sites, the ratio was still higher- indicating there is some constraint of synonymous mutations in functional genes. 

They go on to propose a model for determining the time at which Mpa diverged from Ma, to determine if Mpa every produced a functional protein.  They identified Mpa arising 24Mya, while Mpa became inactive 17Mya. While the complete loss of two introns at different times seems likely, Nishioka had previously proposed that losing 1 intron in rat insulin I does not render the gene inactive, while a loss of 2 introns would. 

Finally, the identify a high level of conservation in the third exon in comparing Mpa and Ma, though Mpa has 3 deletions (2 of which result in frameshifts).  Due to this, they hypothesize that 3rd exon of Mpa arose recent from recombination with one of the a-globin genes (Ma').  

### Importance:
Miyata et al. were able to identify evolutionary pressures by comparing DNA sequences of the a-globin gene. At a time when sequencing was a mere infant, this was no small feat. By leveraging differentials between Mouse a-globin, Rabbit a-globin, and Mouse pseudo-a-globin genes, researchers presented a model to describe the evolution of this pseudogene, highlighting the effects of minimal-to-no constraints on the gene (substantially higher mutations in functional blocks).  They also do identify there are some constraints on synonymous mutation regions, even though these are thought to to be "silent."
