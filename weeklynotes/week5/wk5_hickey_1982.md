### NonCoding DNA elements:
NC DNA has been suggested to simply persist as "selfish" DNA, serving only itslef in replication as much as possible. While the frequency of a repeat within the average genome may increase, this does not mean that it has spread to additional cells, while the average copy number per cell would still increase.  Frequency vs prevalence (expressivity vs penetrance) In asexual populations, the entirety of evolutionary fate of these regions would be dependent on the survival of their hosts, and if they pose no fitness benefit, there would be no systematic tendancy towards an increase in their prevalence. 

The spreading of elements depends not only on sexuality and diploidy, but also on out-breeding.  I.e. if a population were self-fertilizing, we wouldnt see any spreading, or increase, of the prevalence of the element. TEs can spread through a population due to their ability to move about the genome after zygote formation.  This means it does not DEPEND on sex, but rather biparental reproduction. The fitness of these TEs, when spreading rapidly, is greater than their hosts.  Once these elements have become fixed in the population, their fitness is equal to that of their hosts. 

###Rise of transposable element prevalence despite fitness detriment
**If the rate at which an element is able to spread to new genomes is greater than the selective pressure against it, we will see rise to fixation of this element, regardless of any fitness deteriment. Once the element has reached an appreciable proportion of the population, the selection against individuals containing said element almost becomes unimportant.**  I.e. if 90% of individuals have the element within their genomes, it would colonize the remaining 10% unless it were nearly lethal. This would result in the transposable element becoming fixed, and also a decrease in average fitness of the population as a whole. With this activity, selection can be acting upon the element itself, or also to select for compensatory mutations. 


Transposable elements are often thought of in how they move around a genome, but in order to rise in prevalence within a population of genomes, they must be transferrable to other haploid genomes (of a diploid system) and thus passed on to progeny. **The new addition to the discussion of TEs that Hickey brings is highlighting the potential for these TEs to be harmful, yet still able to spread.** 

###Retroviruses, Introns, and even Sex from TEs
They suggest that their model is potentially a transposable precursor of existing introns. RNA splicing may have evolved as a means to combat the initial insertion of an element into a functional gene. Or, it is also suggested that splicing is inherent to the element as a mechanism for which to extricate itself from the flanking regions. 

Retroviruses may have evolved from TEs, with prokaryotic insertion sequences being evolutionary ancestors of LTR. If introns are derived from these prok insertion seqs and equivalent to LTRs of TEs, exon shuffling and oncogene mobilization may both be an "accidental" result of insertion element behavior. We see a low occurance of TEs in yeast, and even lower in mitochondria, yet we still see TEs in bacteria due to indirect infection via conjugative plasmids.  

Hickey goes as far to suggest that, as spread of TEs depends upon sexual reproduction, any transposon that caused sex in the host would greatly favor its own spread and sex may be a product of parasitic genes. This presents a mechanism for early maintenance of sexual reproduction, eventually being usurped by the benefits of allelic reshuffling.
