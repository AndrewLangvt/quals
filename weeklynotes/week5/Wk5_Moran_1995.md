## Paper- Moran 1995
	
### Reasoning:
Moran wanted to observe the evolution of prokaryotes existing in endosymbiotic relationships.  She argues that (1) endosymbiont sequences should evolve faster (2) the evolution should occurr at sites under selection, not neutral ones (3) any mutational bias- some bases favored as endpoints over others- should have a larger effect on base composition of the genome. *Hypothesis- neutral mutations should accumulate at the same rate in endosymbionts and free living species, but deleterious mutations should accumulate faster in endysymbionts.*

### Methods:
Their study used (1) an endosymbiont, (2) a closely related free living species, and (3) a reference taxon. Aligning 16s and *trp* sites shared by all three taxa, distances were calculated in tandem (performed two test within each group as they had multiple sequences available for each taxon). Only nondegenerate sites were observed as all synonymous sites were saturated for all genes. 

The interplay of selection, even weak selection, and mutational bias.  In larger populations, weak seletion acting upon sites can be very effetive, and evolution of these populations should not be effected by mutational bias.  In smaller populations (endosymbionts) selection will be far less apt to override the effects of mutational bias, perhaps causing a shift in genomic base composition. 

### Findings:

**Muller's Ratchet** predicts the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations in asexually populations

*ds* levels are similar in *trp* genes, supporting "synonymous mutation are essentially neutral and subject to similar levels of selective constraint." Also see similar *ds* between *Buchnera sp* comparison and *E.coli-S. typhimurium* comparisons, suggesting roughly equal divergence times.  Ultimately, lower *ds/dn* for *Buchnera* is due to elevated rates of nonsynonymous substitutions, supporting their hypothesis that increased rates of evloution in *Buchnera* is due to an accumulation of deleterious mutations. If this were not the case, and it were due to mutation rate or generation time, we would not see mutation at more nonsynon sites than synon. Additionally, *Buchnera* favors A/T rich codons. 

Evolution of *Buchnera* is driven by increased rate of fixation of mildly deleterious mutations (smaller pops and no recombination), and a favored A/T rich codons. 

### Importance:
Findings of *Buchnera* fit mutational bias and mullers ratchet (genomes of an asexual population accumulate deleterious mutations in an irreversible manner). The speedup in substitution cannot be solely due to selection on genomic base composition as this would be concentrated to synon sites rather than nonsyon- the opposite is seen.  
They do find similar biases in other endosymbionts, but also see base compositions of 50%GC (close to free-living relatives).  While this bias is likely species-specific, they do still observe an accumulation of deleterious mutations. 

Moran also posits that adaptive evolution of hosts (retain sexual recombination and large populations) may compensate for deleterious evolution of endosymbionts, as well as compensatory processes in the endosymbionts themselves. 

Also mention that in lineages subject to Muller's rachet, selection can favor increased severity of deleterious mutations.
