*This review article focused on driving home the unique evolutionary information that can be gathered by studying adaptation within the confines of an island*

Three observations Darwin made whilst on the Galapagos Islands contributed to his realization that **species are not immutable**:

1. Closely related populations on nearby islands vary in appearance 
2. An islands inhabitants generally share similarities with other forms on the adjacent continent, rather than with species occupying similar environments elsewhere in the world
3. Darwin was informed by the ornithologist John Gould that many of the bird species in the Galapagos Islands that seemed to belong to different families were, in fact, all related members of a single family, previously unknown to science — and now known as Darwin’s finches.

Groups of islands can function as replicates in which general evolutionary patterns can be distinguished from unique outcomes.

**Islands are lasting focal points** for evolutionary studies for two main reasons:

1. Many are either volcanic in origin or have been completely under water at some point in their history and are thus, quite young.
2. Many islands and archipelagoes are distant from other land masses, and some have been isolated, with low rates of colonization, for long periods. 

Almost no examples exist of ancestral birds splitting into two descendant species on islands smaller than Madagascar.  This suggest that on smaller islands the selective pressures are not strong enough to provide the evolutionary force needed for a split. With few exceptions, it seems that **allopatric circumstances are a prerequisite for speciation events on small islands.** Additionaly, despite the lack of speciation on small islands, birds will **readily diverge on archipelagoes**. Generally, as islands increase in size, so does the prevalence of speciation.  This may be because larger islands present more opportunites for allopatric isolation and also may have more niche space allowing for the coexistence of more species.  

####Speciation

- Ancestral species colonizes one island of archipelago
- This species then colonizes the other islands
- populations of different islands evolve to different species

	**Allopatry**
	- species evolve, adapting to different environmental conditions on different islands
	- each species colonizes the other islands in the archipelago
	
	**Sympatry**
	
	- each species colonizes the other islands in the archipelago
	- species evolve, adapting to minimize competition with other species (character displacement)

####Adaptive Radiation

- Colonization of species-poor environment
- allopatric speciation & subsequent recolonization --> sympatry of 2 or more species
- species compete for resources, selection will favor adaptations that reduce competition (morphological divergence and resource specialization)
- ultimately produces clade of taxa specialized to use a broad spectrum of ecological space
- Character displacement- drives evolutionary divergence with the classic signature that species are more dissimilar in sympatry than in allopatry. 

####Evolutionary Determinism
- Evolutionary determinism in adaptive radiations- species-for-species matching between separately evolving groups, though this is rare and only occurrs when the two start from a similar state (location, status, condition)
- Identical phenotypes should not be expected- we should expect to see convergence at the level of niche fillings

The island rule- small mammals become larger while large mammals become smaller.  Explanations for this rule include:

- decreased predation levels relinquish necessity for size (large - defend, small - hide)
- intermediate size may be more energetically favorable

###Importance:
This paper presents many different evolutionary theories which are able to be visualized in perhaps a more concrete fashion when island populations are considered.  There are certainly unique gradients of selective pressures seen on mainland-species populations, and likely continued research of island-bound species will reveal aspects of evolution that remain hidden on a larger land mass.
