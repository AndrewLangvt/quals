## Paper3: Grant and Grant 2002

### Why they did it:  
This report was published over 30 years into the Grant's research of Finch species on the Galapagos. While preliminary findings (see Hoag and Grant, 1981) focused on a single species microevolutionary patterns over a three-year period, this report reflects on thirty years of annual observations among two ground Finch species, *G. fortis* and *G. scandens*, on a single island (Daphne Major) of the Galapagos archipelago. Thus this work encompasses not only their earlier work quantifying individual instances of directional selection, but demonstrates how the stochasticsity inherent in long term selection patterns. There had been few experimental studies investigating natural selection outside of a lab; there were fewer studies that made such investigations continuously across decades. Such longitudinal measures of environmental change, (heritable) phenotypic variation, and pedigree analyses in a single location enabled two features to be studied directly: natural selection and introgressive hybridization.

### What they did:
 

The researchers used standardized metrics to study fecundity, foraging behavior, seed abundance and distribution, and morphological characteristics of Finches over the entire study; notably the key physical traits in question were reduced from an initial list of six to three: body size, beak size, and beak shape.
