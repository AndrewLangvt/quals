## Paper3: Grant and Grant 2002

### Why they did it:  
This report was published over 30 years into the Grant's research of Finch species on the Galapagos. While preliminary findings (see another article we're reading - [Hoag and Grant, 1981] [link1]) focused on a single species microevolutionary patterns over a three-year period, this report reflects on thirty years of annual observations among two ground finch species, *G. fortis* and *G. scandens*, on a single island (Daphne Major) of the Galapagos archipelago. Thus this work encompasses not only their earlier work quantifying individual instances of directional selection for a single species, but demonstrates how the stochasticsity inherent in long term selection patterns among species occupying a single geographic area. There had been few experimental studies investigating natural selection outside of a lab; there were fewer studies that made such investigations continuously across decades. Such longitudinal measures of environmental change, (heritable) phenotypic variation, and pedigree analyses in a single location enabled two features to be studied directly: natural selection and introgressive hybridization.

### What they did:  
The researchers used standardized metrics to study fecundity, foraging behavior, seed abundance and distribution, and morphological characteristics of two finch species, *G. fortis* (ground finch) and *G. scandens* (cactus finch).  The physical traits in question were reduced from an initial list of six measures to three synthetic traits: body size, beak size, and beak shape.

### What they found:  
Mean body size and beak shape changed throughout the study, defying the null expectation of no change over time. However, the direction and rate of change differed between species:
- *G. fortis* had body and beak size changes in different directions of different magnitudes at different intervals (**Figures 1.A and 1.B**). In addition, beak shape shifted abruptly but then remained consistent for many generations (**Fig. 1.C**).
- *G. scandens*, a larger finch, reduced body and beak size (**Fig. 1.D and 1.E**) and ultimately retained a more blunt beak shape - similar to *G. fortis* - by the end of the reported observation period.  

Long term observations of selection events suggested four key findings:
1. Body and beak size traits were subject to selection more fequently than beak shape (**Fig 2.A - F; pay attention to the y-axis measures among each subfigure**). Body size was subject to selection about every 3 years.
2. 

### What it meant:

### Additional thoughts:
FFT: It's a complicated idea, but the simplext explanation here... can't you get differential selection intensities on a trait because certain phenotypes are more removed from the optimal phenotype? So if body size seems to be under the greatest degree of selection, is that another way of stating that either:
(a) body size optimization is very sensitive in an environment, or
(b) there are many different ways for selection to identify heritable changes to navigate that body size genetic landscape?
