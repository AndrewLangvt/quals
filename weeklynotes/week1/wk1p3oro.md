## Paper3: Grant and Grant 2002

### Why they did it:  
This report was published over 30 years into the Grant's research of Finch species on the Galapagos. While preliminary findings (see another article we're reading - [Hoag and Grant, 1981] [link1]) focused on a single species microevolutionary patterns over a three-year period, this report reflects on thirty years of annual observations among two ground finch species, *G. fortis* and *G. scandens*, on a single island (Daphne Major) of the Galapagos archipelago. Thus this work encompasses not only their earlier work quantifying individual instances of directional selection for a single species, but demonstrates how the stochasticsity inherent in long term selection patterns among species occupying a single geographic area. There had been few experimental studies investigating natural selection outside of a lab; there were fewer studies that made such investigations continuously across decades. Such longitudinal measures of environmental change, (heritable) phenotypic variation, and pedigree analyses in a single location enabled two features to be studied directly: natural selection and introgressive hybridization.

### What they did:  
The researchers used standardized metrics to study fecundity, foraging behavior, seed abundance and distribution, and morphological characteristics of two finch species, *G. fortis* (ground finch) and *G. scandens* (cactus finch).  The physical traits in question were reduced from an initial list of six measures to three synthetic traits: body size, beak size, and beak shape.

### What they found:  
#### About selection...
Mean body size and beak shape changed throughout the study, defying the null expectation of no change over time. However, the direction and rate of change differed between species:
- *G. fortis* had body and beak size changes in different directions of different magnitudes at different intervals (**Figures 1.A and 1.B**). In addition, beak shape shifted abruptly but then remained consistent for many generations (**Fig. 1.C**).
- *G. scandens*, a larger finch, reduced body and beak size (**Fig. 1.D and 1.E**) and ultimately retained a more blunt beak shape - similar to *G. fortis* - by the end of the reported observation period.  

Long term observations of selection events suggested four key findings when comparing the two species:
1. Body and beak size traits were subject to selection more fequently than beak shape (**Fig 2.A - F; pay attention to the y-axis measures among each subfigure**). Body size was subject to selection about every 3 years.  
2. Selection intensities can operate unidirectionally or bidirectionally, depending on the finch species in question.   
3. Unidirectional selection has apparent limits - no more than 3 years was the longest observed.    
4. Selection in species is not necessarily (or even usually) synchronous. Observed convergence in phenotype occurred during the most extreme drought, with selection for increased body size happening in both species only in that one instance.  

In addition, the magnitude of evolution for a certain phenotype was highly predictable when considerting selection differentials and heritability (of that phenotype). The key terms: 
- heritability measures the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be explained by genetic factors
- selection differentials are the difference in mean of a phenotype between the parents and the base population  
So if you measured a phenotype of the surviving parents after a selection event and compared it to the pre-selection population, and you know something about how heritable that character is, you'll be able to predict the mangitude of the evolutionary response... also called the Selection Response. See [here] [link2] and [here] [link3] for a few basic ideas.  

#### About introgression...
Inter-species mating happened throughout the study, but typically occurred in very low rates. Instances where F1 hybrids were (relatively) abundant occurred when there were extreme weather patterns: drought or wet conditions resulted in dramatic changes to food resources. One consequence was a major shift in sex ratios (as a result of a major drought) between one species *but not in the other*; the male-skewed *G. scandens* resulted from a disproprotionate decrease in females due to a lack of food resources, however *G. fortis*  was relatively unaffected. Consequently there was increased competition among *G. scandens* males but not *G. fortis* males. A pair of hybrids among *G. s* males with *G. f* females resulted in future F1 backcrosse with *G. s* populations because mate selection is largely derived from paternal song impriting.  There are a few predictions from these mating patterns that were confirmed:
1. Increased beak shape and skewness should occur largely for *G. scandens* and NOT for *G. fortis*. Observations demonstrated that hybrids of *G. scandens* contributed significantly to the difference in mean and variance of beak shape. Likewise, there was no significant effect observed for *G. fortis*.  
2. Change in mean and variance will reduce in magnitude over time for *G. scandens* because hybrid events and backcrosses are becoming more rare. This was observed: hybrid proportion to changing mean is reduced over time; hybrid proportion and overall varaince and skewness in trait is reduced over time (**Fig 5**).  

### What it meant:
With respect to point (3) above, I'd think that this speaks to Fisher's Fundamental Theorem (FFT): you're seeing the rate of fitness decreasing because you don't ever see "selection" at work after 3 years in a row; that's because the underlying genetic variance has been selected out, which is the entire point of FFT: rate of change in fitness (increase) is proportional to additive genetic variance.

### Additional thoughts:
FFT: It's a complicated idea, but the simplext explanation here... can't you get differential selection intensities on a trait because certain phenotypes are more removed from the optimal phenotype? So if body size seems to be under the greatest degree of selection, is that another way of stating that either:
- (a) body size optimization is very sensitive in an environment, or
- (b) there are many different ways for selection to identify heritable changes to navigate that body size genetic landscape?  

Synchronisity and competitive exclusion: why aren't the two finches shifting in the same direction more frequently? The autors note near the end of the paper that they generally eating different seeds/insects. If food resources don't overlap, then perhaps selection for body size won't sync up until you have an extreme drought thereby limiting food to a relatively few plant/seed species - and in that case, you get convergence of a single optimal body size.
