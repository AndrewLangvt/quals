## Paper- Hamilton & Zuk 1982
	
### Reasoning:
The question of mate-choice basis was one not fully elucidated at the time of this paper.  Hamilton and Zuk attempted to determine if they could identify the basis for mate-choice methods, and how much of it stems from genetic quality of an individual. 

### Methods:
Using already available data documenting the presence of six diseases in various trapped birds, they looked at the showiness of each species in comparison to the frequency of parisite presence within that species.  The underlying theory here being that were mate selection based upon genetic quality, or disease resistance in this case, this increased "fitness" would be represented in the phenotype.  When observing a species with greater development of epigamic characteristics, one would expect that species is subject to a wider range of parasites.  Showiness, song quality, and body weight were all documented, and the Goodman & Kruskal method was used to determine association.

### Findings:
They recorded the number of cases of disease by species, and the bird species in which the incidence was found.  These counts were used to calculate disease expectations for each bird species, from which Goodman and Kruskal gammas were calculated as a measure of rank correlation (coefficients of association). In general, they found positive associations at many levels, and more often than negative associations.  They identified positive association in female brightness, which the authors posit is an indication of sexual selection occurring simultaneously in both sexes of monogamous birds. Log weight was more strongly correlated to disease suseptability than any other character.  This is suggested to be a result these larger birds "being a larger target" or perahps that each bite is proportionally a smaller loss of blood.  Both of these would support the the currently sexual selection theory as showiness and larger body size are often connected.   

### Importance:
This paper presents evidence of underlying genetic foundation for sexual selection.  Much of the focus at this time conceptualized sexual selection to be wholly phenotypic, yet this paper drives at a genetic basis.
