## Paper- Trivers & Willard, 1973

### Reasoning:
Starting with Fisher, and following with other biological theorists of that time, argued that natural selection favors parents who invest equally in both sons and daughters.  Trivers & Willard present support for natural selection favoring deviations from the 50/50 sex ratio at conception, which are then canceled out in the local population. 

### Theory:
The authors portray a circumstance in which the condition of a mother at the time of parental investment (PI) will dictate which sex she invests most in.  A healthy mother will invest more in her son, as this could result in a stronger male offspring, which would then exhibit better reproductive success in the next generation if the species exhibited mating at the exclusion of other males.  If the mother were less healthy, her fitness would be stronger were she to invest in daughters, as these offspring (even though weaker) would present higher fitness in the next generation in comparison to equally weak males. 

This model depends on three assumptions:
	
- The condition of the young at the end of the parental investment period will be correlated with the condition of the mother during the time of PI
- Differences in the condition of young at the end of PI will endure into adulthood. 
- Adult males will be differentially helped in reproductive success (when compared to adult females) by slight advantes in condition. 

What then, is the mechanism which controls and adjusts this sex ratio?  The authors suggest it must be grounded in differential mortality by sex, either at the level of sperm cells or rearing of young. In species where maternal investment spans a larger time period, she must be able to adjust investment strategy based upon her condition (longer time period means conditions may deteriorate), and the earlier the better. Differential male mortality in utero has been showin in multiple species, and the majority of this occurrs in early pregnancy.  

### Importance:
While other theorists were supporters of the 50/50 ratio being favored by sexual selection, this paper suggests certain circumstances where a population will intentionally deviate from the 50/50 sex ratio, not because sexual selection favors deteration from the 50/50 ratio, but because sexual selection favors differential parental investment of the sexes depending upon conditions at the time of investment.
