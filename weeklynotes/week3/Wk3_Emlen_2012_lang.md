## Paper- Emlen et al, 2012

### Reasoning:
Exaggerated male ornaments and weapons of sexual selection are characteristics of the best-conditioned individuals.  These exaggerated traits are reliable measurements of male quality, as the characteristics often result from nutritional and physiological conditions- more so than other physiological traits.  Insulin and IGFs (regulators body size and tissue growth) are sensitive to nutritional levels and stress/infection.  The authors show how the exaggerated male traits are responsive to insulin and IGFs, and that increased sensitivity may result in evolutionary steps towards heightened exaggeration in male traits. 

### Methods:
Male rhinoceros beetles, *Trypoxylus dichotomus* were injected with dsRNA to transcription of the insulin receptor (*InR* ) gene. This was done at a developmental stage (transition from larval stage to gut purge) where overal body size was stable, but adult strucutres were still growing which allowed for any response to *InR* dsRNA to be seen in genitalia, wing, or horn growth. 

### Findings:
*InR* transcript abundance for 48 hrs following injection. Genitalia was not sensitive to the injection, wings were sensitive (moderately- 2% decrease in lenght), and horns were found to be highly sensitive (16% decrease in length). 

### Importance:
While the highly concerved insulin/IGF pathway have been long-known to dictate cell proliferation rates in a wide range of taxa, this paper suggests a cop-opting of this pathway in response to strong sexual selection resuling in exaggerated growth of signalling traits. High-condition individuals would have elevated levels of insulin/IGF, while low-condition individuals would have lower levels of these signals, thus resulting in exaggerated traits of high-condition individuals.  While this is certainly an intriguing concept, it fails to elucidate how indivudals sometimes will have traits disproportionate to their condition.  

The authors suggest that increased sensitivity to insulin/IGF would result in exaggerated traits, with the intrinsic property of signal reliability.  Escalated evolution of signals are deemed most likely when said signals are reliable, i.e. low-quality males are unable to "cheat" (signal is a high enough cost that it remains cost ineffective for low-condition individuals to cheat, or the signal is intrinsically unfakable- "index" signals or "good genes" signals).  Larger traits are generally equated to be costly handicaps, thus enforcing signal reliability. Yet, several studies have shown a lack of any cost associated with male ornaments/weapons- so why don't all low-condition males "fake" their traits? The low-quality males, while they may be more sensitive to IGF, they likely do not have access to the fule and nutrients to actually grow those larger phenotypic aspects. 

If exaggerated structures are indeed unfakable metics of quality due to the developmental mechanism responsible for accelerated growth, then the presented hypothesis of "intrinsic reliability" presents explanation for the continued evolution towards bigger and best.  Eventually, the growth reaches a point in wihch the trait also acts as a handicap signal, though only if the trait does NOT exhibit elevated sensitivity to insulin/IGF.  If sensitivity were heightened, this may well explain why some sexually selected structures are reliable signals despite a lack of apparent cost.  The small "bump" that a low-condition male would receive from any adaptation towards heightened sensitivity likely would not be enough to outcompete true high-condition males.  Thus, the hypothesis of "intrinsic reliability" would still stand.
