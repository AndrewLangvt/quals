## Paper- Hughes & Nei 1988
	
### Reasoning:
A high level of heterozygosity is seen in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and this paper attempts identify which of the four presented hypohteses are correct: 

- High mutation rate
- gene conversion or interlocus genetic exchange
- over dominant selection (heterozygous advantage)
- frequency-dependent selection (fitness of a phenotype is dependent upon it's frequency relative to other phenotypes) 

### Methods:
Authors obtained 12 human sequences of the antigen recognition site (ARS) and conducted positive selection analysys (for some reason they keep referring to this as overdominant selection)

**overdominance hypothesis**- allelic combinations from crossing inbred strains are advantageous in the HZ individual. The advantage arises in the survival of alleles that are recessive and harmful to HM individuals. More HZ individuals than expected based upon HWE. 

### Findings:

They found substantially higher dN/dS values for the ARS sequences, than for the other exonic regions which generally were below 1. Exon 4 exhibited a reduction in dS, resulting in dN/dS > 1.
 
- interspecific comparison of ARS- dN>dS
- interspecific comparison of non-ARS- dN<dS
- intraspecific intralocus comparison- dS nearly the same for all 3 regions, while dN is higher for ARS

**mouse data**

- dS lower in non-ARS than in ARS
- dS of exon 4 is particularly low

### Importance:

If mutations are driven by overdominant selection, should see higher dN/dS as its "good to be different." Yet if these are the results of random mutation, would not see any difference in dN and dS. 


Hypotheses:
	
- reject high mutation rate- dS between humans and mice not that high- wouldnt they need to incorporate dN in considering mutational divergence?
- reject gene conversion/interlocus exchange- unequal dN and dS values would not arise without selection
- reject frequency-dependent model- idea that a host with recently arisen mutatn alleles would better survive pathogens who had yet to adapt to the new mutant antigen. While this would explain dN/dS being greater than 1, it does not explain the polymorphism observed, nor the persistance of polymorphic alleles at the MHC

They suggest that their study supports overdominance hypothesis, claiming this to be the first case of overdominant selection (rather than directional selection) established at the molecular level since the sickle-cell anemia gene. It seems strange that they only just mention positive selection in the last paragraph of the paper.  Diversity at MHC is both under selection to be different in some regions (the part that interacts with antigens), and under selection to be very conserved in some regions (structural and some function).
