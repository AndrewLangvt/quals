## Paper- Ohta, Tomoko 1973
	
### Reasoning:
Ohta "organizes the observable facts" so as to present an argument for the importance of slightly deleterious mutations in the progression of evolution. 

autocorrelation- aka serial correlation- correlation of a signal to the delayed copy of itself as a function of dealy. This is often used as a means to assess repeating patterns. 

**covarion model**- concomittantly variable codon- phylogenetic algorithm allowing the hypothesized rate of evolution at individual codons to vary autocorrelatedly. "Under the covarion model, the rates of evolution on different branches of a hypothesized phylogenetic tree vary in an autocorrelated way, and the rates of evolution at different codon sites in an aligned set of DNA or RNA sequences vary in a separate but autocorrelated manner." (wiki)

Covarions vary together. just because theyre covarions does not mean theyre correlated. 

**infinite allele model**- Kimura & Crow 1964- an attempt to determine the percentage of loci would be HM in a finite hiploid population. The probability of being HM is `1/(4*effective_population_size + 1)` and the number of alleles maintained is the inverse of homozygosity. 

**stepwise mutation model**- Kimura & Ohta- assumes that if an allele mutation results in a state change, mutations in repetitive genomic regions will "increase or decrease by a single repeat unit, at a fixed rate." model assumes random mating and selective equivalence of loci. 

**Genetic load**- from wiki- difference between the fitness of an average genotype in a population and the fitness of some reference genotype, which may be either the best present in a population, or may be the theoretically optimal genotype. 

###Findings:
Ohta argues that slightly deleterious mutations are more conceivable to explain mutations in paired regions of tRNAs and protein residues.  In tRNA's, as the paired regions are almost exatly paired, it would follow that the initial mutation resulted in a minute decrease in pairing efficiency, for which the second mutation compensated. Again, a similar argument follows for prolypeptides in that the folding of amino acids is highly specific and an alteration to a single residue would disturb this organization.  Thus, the initial mutation is slightly deleterious, allowing for further evolutionary change by subsequent compensatory mutations. 

In observing enzyme polymorphisms, ratio of effective alleles (*ne*: reciprocal of sum of squares of allelic frequencies) to actual alleles (*na*), expects a more even distribution of alleles in electrophoresis. Ohta identifies this model as inappropriate for GE, as it will not separate by anything other than charge. He suggests a stepwise allele production model, and shows that the effective number of neutral alleles in a finite population is `*ne* = (1 + 8 *Nev*)^1/2` where *Ne* is effective population size and *v* is mutation rate per gamete. 

###Importance:
Ohta's purpose was to gather the current perspectives on null mutations, and suggest that these null mutations in some cases are not entirely neutral.  He argues that they are compensatory mutations that are the result of initial minutely deleterious mutations that occurred first. 

##Questions: 

where does the 4 and 8 come from?

discuss covarion...
