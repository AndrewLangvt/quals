## Paper- McDonald & Kreitman 1991

### Reasoning:
While there had been previous study of mutations and the neutral evolution model, few had assessed the adaptive nature of these mutations. The *Adh* locus was well-characterized, and subject to natural selection, but no knowledge of the non-synonymous mutations were adaptive in any way. 

### Methods:
They observed sequences and polymorphsism seen in the alcohol dehydrogenase (*Adh*) gene of *Drosophila*. Their assumption was that "if protein evolution occurs by neutral processes, the ratio of replacement to synonymous fixed substitutions should be the same as the ratio of replacement to synonymous polymorphisms." They identified *fixed* mutations as those that arose before a speciation event, while *polymorphism* was within-species branchings. 

The null is that the gene is under neutral selection- MK test uses dN/dS test to determine fixed vs polymorphic mutations to identify mutation types and rates. 

They assumed for simplicity that all nt mutations are equally likely... They argue this would not change the ratio of *fixed* substitutions to ratio for polymorphism. 

### Findings:
They found that the ratio of non-synon to synon substitutions that are fixed are significantly greater than the ratio of non-synon to synon polymorphisms. 

### Importance:

They argue that syn mutations fixed by selection will be a polymorphism for a shorter period of time than that of a non-synon mutation fixed by genetic drift, suggesting that adaptive substitutions are less likely to appear as polymorphisms.
