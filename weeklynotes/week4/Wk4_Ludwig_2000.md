## Paper- Ludwig 2000

	
### Reasoning:
There had been a great deal of characterization of the *even-skipped* stripe 2 expression, highlighting the highly conserved expression across eukaryotes. Though there was little research, at the time, on the specific stripe 2 element itself, specifically regarding binding sites.  Ludwig et al address this knowledge gap, and propose a mechanims of evoluton for eukaryotic regulatory sequences. 

### Methods:
Using two species of *Drosophila*  - *pseudoobscura* and *melanogaster* - native SE2 sequences were placed in a reporter-gene construct to observe localization of expression. The expression of these native constructs in the ant-post axis of the embryos was indistinguishable from that of native *eve* expression. This would seem to indicate that either the mutation differences between the two SE2s was inconsequential, or the changes balance one another out such that there is no net change in expression. 

The authors believed that, any chimeric enhancer containing the conserved sequences of S2E would have WT function if the sequences were only necessary for *eve* stripe 2 expression.  If the sequence differences between lineages were functional, generation of a chimeric enhancer resulting in disrupted expression would be possible. Two chimeric enhancers were constructed, essentially a swap of the two S2E enchaner distal/proximal regions. 

### Findings:
The two chimeric enhancers did indeed disrupt WT function.  One enhancer resulted in a posterior shift of expression, while the other caused an expansion of both the ant/post borders of the stripe. They deduced that the chimeric enhancers shifted the sensitivity to bicoid and hunchback gradients, as well as reducing the effectiveness of Kruppel repression. 

### Importance:
The theoretical model of phenotypic traits under stabilizing selection suggests that "nearly neutral variation reaches fixation at an appreciable rate by the process of genetic drift." This implies that lineages can differ by many functionally compensatory mutations, yet selection will still maintain functional conservation of gene expression.  

An intriguing thought then lies in how this would affect phylogenetic analysis of enhancers or other cis regulatory elements? Selection "sees" and acts upon the gene expression, yet the mutations underlying variation in expression are also being selected for/on based upon the phenotype resulting from their interaction. 

In 2015, [Villar et al.][link1] studied enhancer evolution across 20 mammalian species.  They found that promoter regions are highly conserved, while ehancer elements are rapidly changing.  This would suggest that the evolution of regulatory elements is a driving force of evolution.  They were also able to link enhancer regions to lineage-specific positive selection.
