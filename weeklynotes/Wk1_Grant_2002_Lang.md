## Paper- Grant, Peter R & Grant, Rosemary B 2002

### Reasoning:
The Grants were attempting to elucidate how the combined effects of "predictable" evolutionary pressure (natural selection and heritability) and "unpredictable" long-term evolutionary pressure resulting from environmental shifts function to drive the morphological & genetic evolution actually observed in nature. They argue that long-term studies which practice "annual or more frequent sampling may have more benefits" and would be better equipped to uncover some of the slower-moving changes/unforseen environmental shifts and their downstream effects on the population as a whole. A desirable approach; dare I say, a logical one? :-) 

### Methods:
Populations of Darwin's finches (*Geospiza fortis* and *G. scandens*) were closely observed on the Galapagos islands for a 30-year period. They recorded both population size and reproduction by individual each year.  Measurements from 6 traits were reduced by principal components analysis [What is PCA, you ask?][link1] to **body size, beak size, and beak shape** and compared over the 30-year stretch (null hypothesis being that there would be no change in the means of these traits).  

### Findings:
As shown in (**Figure 1**) in the text, the null hypothesis was clearly rejected. Averages of body size, beak size, and beak shape all fluctuated greatly over the course of the study.  No surprise, body size and beak size show a simliar pattern, and a notable drought event occurred in the mid 70s.  

- body and beak size were subject to natural selection more often than beak shape
	(**they set alpha at 0.01 "to allow for the lack of complete independence of traits"**)
	- body size subject to selection once every 3 years- once per generation (4.5 for *G. fortis* 5.5 for **G. scandens*)
- Considering only statistically significant selection differentials, the species differed in the directions of net selection on size traits
	- *G. fortis* selection in both directions w/equal freq. (**Fig. 2, A-C**)
	- *G. scandens* selection repeatedly favored lg. body size and "in no instance favored small beak size (**Fig. 2, D-E what about years 97-99??**)
- Unidirectional selection occurred in successive years, up to a max of 3 yrs (**Fig. 2. A, D, E**)
- Selection events were not synchronous, except for late 1970s (following a drought- large size was favored)

By comparing trait means before and after selection events, they determined selection events occurred:

- *G. fortis* 8 times (body size 4, beak size 3, beak shape 1)
- *G. scandes* 7 times (body size 2, beak size 5)

The Grants also noticed that while morphological changes can be largely accounted for by selection, there are still times of discrepancy (1990s- beak shape **Fig. 2F & 1F**)
Four potential contributors to nonrandom additions- conspecific and heterospecific residents and immigrants- though these potetial breeding events seem to present little to no fitness loss nor greatly alter morphological traits. 

**Introgression Hypothesis Predicts** (*both observed here*)

1. increase in variance and skewness in morphological distributions
	- increase expected to be larger in *G. scandes* due to first-gen backcrosses making up a proportionately larger contribution to sample size (it was indeed greater)
2. variance and skewness will decrease if F1 hybrids and first generation backcrosses are deleted from total samples. 
	- this was also found true of *G. scandes*- F1 hybrids and 1st gen backcrosses are smaller in body & beak size and have less pointed beaks

There was a porportionally greater gene flow from *G. fortis* to *G. scandes* due to a high mortality rate for socially subordinate females of *G. scandes* after 1983. This was a result of the decline of their principal dry-season food. *G. fortis* was able to retain a 1:1 sex ratio, thus there was greater competition amongst *G. fortis* females for mates when breeding resumed. 

### Importance:

The evolutionary process is not one that can be easily observed in discrete studies.  Undertaking multi-decade studies can begin to scratch the surface of underlying pressures and driving forces of evolution, though an additional aspect of "successful" observance of evolution is a high frequency of sampling to document minute and fleeting patterns of change.  We also see from this study that a mere reversal in direction of selection will not necessarily result in a return to the original phenotypic morphology.  Finally, while hybridization and selection were often presented in terms of selective disadvantage resulting from hybridization, this study posits that these two forces may interact in different fashions- the hybridization seemed to have been, in part, a result of selection for pointed beaks (mate choice is partly determiend by imprinting of parental beak morphology).
