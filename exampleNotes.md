# This is where you write your title

## This is where you write the subheading for each paper
This is where you write your observations  

**This is how you make your text very bold**  

*This is how you italicize it if you prefer*  

Note that if you don't put two spaces at the end of every line you won't get a nice space apart. Here is an example of where you don't get two spaces between two lines.
And yet despite there being a space in the editor this is one long paragraph.  
But if I put two spaces after the "...this is one long paragraph" sentence previously, we get a new line!.  

- You can make bullet points too.  
  - and you can make sub bullet points. *fancy*
